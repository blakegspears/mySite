    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>My name is <b>Blake Spears</b>. I was born and raised in Louisiana. In 2014, I decided to join the <mark>U.S. Navy</mark>. I became an aviation electrician's mate (AE) at HSC-23 in Coronado, CA, where I performed maintenance activites on H60S helicopters<sub>13</sub> and MQ-8B<sup>4</sup> drone helicopters. Having completed two overseas deployments over 6 years of active duty service, I decided to transfer to the Navy Reserves, and move to Minnesota, where my wife and daughter were currently living. Moving to Elk River, I found a job as a construction worker, installing underground power and fiber optic lines. I have gained knowledge and skillsets to include heavy equipment operator, fiber cable installer, and a <i>Class A Commercial Driver's License</i>. Working here for three years has made me realize I do not want to work here the rest of my life. I really want to be a <mark>software engineer</mark>, where I can have a more flexible schedule and create new websites, apps and more to change the world. I enjoy <ins>problem-solving and critical thinking</ins> and I am excited to see what life will throw my way. </p>
